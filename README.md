In this learning project, I designed a classic Hangman game. Written fully in Python and using the command line interface,
the program has a login phase and a game pahse. After successfully logged in, the user tries to guess, letter by letter,
the word that is hidden. There are 3 levels which, for now, take effect only in the number of lives the user has.

Next Steps:
  - get a source of words (could use an API);
  - improve login system (could use SSO);
  - build frontend.
